## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using a variety of machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and validation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, scales features, and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implements several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses cross-validation and various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization:** Plots performance metrics to compare different models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
